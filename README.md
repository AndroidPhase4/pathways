## General Information
- Pathways is our final team project part of the Google Black+ Android Development Course
- The problem we hope PathWays solve is to give the user information and help guide them into making the right career start.
- The Purpose of are app is to be a resource guide to users who are just are beginning to have interest in a tech career.
- We undertook this challenge because we all struggle on which course to take, which botocamp to enroll in, what our actual interest in tech is.
